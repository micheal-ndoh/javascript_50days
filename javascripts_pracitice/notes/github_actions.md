# GitHub Actions and CI/CD

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a platform for automating software workflows, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). It allows you to create custom workflows that automatically build, test, and deploy your code.

## Key Concepts

1. **Workflow**: A configurable automated process that runs one or more jobs
2. **Job**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner
3. **Step**: An individual task that can run commands or actions
4. **Action**: A reusable unit of code that can be used in workflows

## Workflow File Structure

A typical workflow file (.github/workflows/main.yml) looks like:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-image .
        
      - name: Push to GHCR
        run: docker push ghcr.io/username/repo:tag
```

## Use in the Project

In this project, we'll create a workflow that:

1. Builds both Rust and JavaScript Docker images
2. Runs tests for both implementations
3. Pushes the images to GitHub Container Registry
4. Uses matrix builds to handle multiple configurations
